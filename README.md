# X-Editable (Bootstrap 5 Fork)

This project is a fork of [vitalets/x-editable](https://github.com/vitalets/x-editable), adapted to work with **Bootstrap 5** while maintaining compatibility with jQuery.

## Why This Fork?
The original **x-editable** library was designed for Bootstrap 3 and has not been actively maintained. This fork modernizes the codebase and updates it to support:

- **Bootstrap 5** 
- **Bootstrap Icons** (replacing Glyphicons)
- General improvements for usability and maintainability

### Using npm:
```sh
npm install x-editable-bootstrap5
```
